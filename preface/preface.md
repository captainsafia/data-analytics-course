# Preface

Early in the summer of 2015, I decided to start teaching a Data Analytics with Python workshop series in Chicago, in partnership with the local PyLadies group. I prepared a rough curriculum of topics that started with the fundamentals of Python and ended with an in-depth discussion of neural networks. Halfway through the series, a student approached me and mentioned that the poorly-maintained repository where I kept the notes from the class was hard to understand. I felt ashamed and disappointed. The workshops themselves were engaging and clear lectures, but I hadn't been able to convey that in the online notes. I decided it was about time I formalized my teaching methodology into a book of sorts.

I do not consider myself much of a writer, but I do consider myself quite a good teacher. I started studying data science independently at a very young age and have a very good perspective into the trials and tribulations of independent study of the field. Through the years, I've acquired a unique perspective into what works and what doesn't when getting first exposure to statistics, programming, and machine learning.If you're reading this because you are curious about this "data science" thing, I understand how you're feeling. I've been there myself. I've made sure that this book won't force you into the same traps and pitfalls that I fell into when I was learning.

This book will provide software engineers a perspective into the world that their data science colleagues embody. For those curious about the world of data science or career prospects in the field, this book will provide a gentle introduction to the field and open the door to much more complex tutorials.
