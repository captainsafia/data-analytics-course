# Data Science from Start to Finish

This GitBook is a beginner-friendly introduction to the fundamentals of data analytics from data collection to data modeling. This book is inspired by the Introduction to Data Analytics with Python workshop series that I ran in Chicago. It is currently in-progress but feel free to provide what feedback on what is there by sending an email to safia (at) safia (dot) rocks. 

This book is made with coffee, love, and my unwavering dedication to make data science accessible to all.
